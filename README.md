# Recurrent-Neural-Nets-NLP
This repository contains work on RNNs and on NLP. 
A Many-to-One setting is described in Lab1_RNNs. The goal is to train a network on the user reviews to predict whether the user is going to like/dislike a movie. This work features Embeddings, language models and LSTMs.
A Sequence-to-Sequence setting is presented in LAB2_RNNs, where the objective is to generate a symphony, after training a network to learn the musical notes "language model". 
The third notebook contains more basic techniques of NLP, namely TF-IDF, item tokenizers etc.
