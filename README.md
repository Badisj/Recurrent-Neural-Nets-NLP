# Recurrent-Neural-Nets-NLP
This repository contains work on RNNs and on NLP. 

A Many-to-One setting is described in Lab1_RNNs.ipynb. The goal is to train a network on the user reviews to predict whether the user is going to like/dislike a movie. This work features Embeddings, language models and LSTMs.

A Sequence-to-Sequence setting is presented in LAB2_RNNs.ipynb, where the objective is to generate a symphony, after training a network to learn the musical notes "language model". 

NLP_word_vectors_classification.ipynb contains a comparison between baseline approaches for text classification, namely Count/TFIDF-vectorization and RNN-based approaches involving embeddings and LSTMs.

The notebook basic_tokenizers.ipynb contains more basic techniques of NLP, namely TF-IDF, item tokenizers etc.

More current work to come in the next few weeks, stay tuned.
